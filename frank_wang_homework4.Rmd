What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated? How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
```{r}
choco = read.csv("choco.csv")
print(nrow(choco))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) + geom_bar() + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Number of Ratings") + 
  ggtitle("Number of Ratings Each Year")
```
