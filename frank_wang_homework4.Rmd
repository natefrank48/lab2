What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated? How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
```{r}
choco = read.csv("choco.csv")
print(nrow(choco))
str(choco)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) + geom_bar()
```
